    "The League of Legends (LoL) is a multiplayer online battle arena video game. Since its first release in 2009, the game has gained great popularity among players around the globe. In September 2016, it was estimated that there were over 100 million active players each month. From a larger scope, online gaming industry is consistently on the rise. Massively multiplayer(MMO) gaming generated revenue of roughly 19.9 billion U.S. dollars in 2016 [(1)](## References:). In this project, we obtains dynamic data including players and matches as well as static data from the official Riot API [(2)](## References:) through Cassiopeia, a framework dedicated to the Riot API [(3)](## References:). We then proceed onto further manipulation and analysis of the data and eventually building different functionalities like champion recommendation, win prediction and match scoring system for LoL players."

    "The official Roit API has already provided a great many of different game data, and Cassiopeia helps to wrap everything up and have a great way to deal with rate limit. Everything seems good with these two ready. But before we beign to crawl real-time user data, it'll be of great help to design our database first to store all the crawled data.  The purpose of this project is to analyze game-level behavior, so instead of retrieving all the massive and diverse data type, we mainly focuses on game-related data including champions, summoners, items, every match's data including match attributes and statistics, participant data and participant statistics, team statistics and match frame events.\n",

    "Considering the enormous data amount and limited time and space, we decide to focus on Season 8's 5v5 classic rank solo data with tier in bronze, silver, gold, platinum and diamond, which is the most common type of matches the players play. And the game behavior in this range is also the biggest concern for most users. Also, to make things easier we use Sqlite as our database system. We design our database scheme as follows:\n",

    "With database settled down, we can start to build our crawler. This crawler is based on Cassiopeia which wrap the official Roit API efficiently and works quite well with the rate limit problems. Detailed usage of this package can be seen at [Cassiopeia API](#). The idea behind this crawler is simple: To begin with we'll first collect some player's name uniformly distributed from tier bronze to diamond as our seed players. This is done manually by either asking friends for player name or looking them up at [op.gg](#). \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"op.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "We collected 50 players, each of the tier (bronze, silver, gold, platinum and diamond) contains 10 to make sure the data we get is balanced (We added some extra seed players from our friends since we found some player name doesn't exist possibly due to their modifying names in this season). Then we put the seed players in initial queue. We'll loop over the queue, for every player we'll first store it in database and mark it as crawled, then we'll get all this player's match history in Season's 5v5 solo rank, for every match, we'll first store all the players in this match in database, and mark them as uncrawled if they don't appear in database before. Then we'll store every participant's statistics, each team's statistics, and the match statistics as well, and after looping over this player's match, we'll move on to the next player in the queue. After we loop through the current queue, we'll use a SQL sentence to query all the players who haven't been crawled yet, and add them to the queue and begi next loop. The crawler will stop when either all the players in this season have been crawled or we've already obtained the total amount of data we want. Detailed code snippets can be refered as follows. The code below has clear structure and proper comments, and should be easy to understand."

So we'd like to first explore the relationship between champions. This is a unsupervised clustering task, and we use Agglomerative algorithm to get better results. Agglomerative clustering is a kind of hierarchical clustering in a bottom-up way. It starts with every data point as a single cluster, at every step, two most similar clusters will be merged into a new cluster, and this step is repeated until we reach the number of cluster we want or all data points come to a one huge cluster.
